\begin{recipe}{Pizzelles} {20 - 30 cookies} {1 hour}

\freeform \textit{This is an easy good Italian cookie that is not too sweet.}

\ingredient[\fr12]{cups}{butter, melted}
\ingredient[\fr34]{cups}{sugar}
\ingredient[3]{}{eggs}
\ingredient[1]{tbsp}{anise or vanilla extract}

In a large bowl beat eggs and sugar together. Stir melted butter and flavoring
    until the mixture is smooth.

\ingredient[2]{tsp}{baking powder}
\ingredient[1 \fr34]{cups}{flour}

Combine the baking powder, flour in a large bowl and make a well in the middle.
    Add egg mixture to the flour mixture and fold together until combined.

\freeform

Preheat the pizzelle iron. The iron may need to be greased with butter or oil
    before baking the cookies. In my experience, I have generally not needed to,
    but your mileage may vary. Drop about one tablespoon of batter onto each
    circle on the iron and close it. Bake until the cookie reaches the desired
    color. The baking time is somewhere between 45 seconds to 1 \fr12 minutes.
    Repeat for the rest of the batter.
